This was a final project that I did for The Origins I: HTML course on Codedex. It amazes me on how much I have improved in coding since then, and looking at it brings back memories to when I was still starting out! The restaurant menu has no styling, except for a few background colors, and it is all aligned to the left and there it just looks ugly. But it still means a lot to me since this was my first ever project. :]
